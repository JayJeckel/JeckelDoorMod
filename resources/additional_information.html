<p>The mod removes the default, vanilla recipe for the door and replaces it with a recipe that follows the pattern introduced in the 1.8 version of Minecraft. Similarly, the vanilla recipe for the trapdoor has been replaced with one specific to oak planks.</p>

<p>Additionally, the vanilla Oak and Iron Doors, as well as the vanilla Oak Trapdoor, have been moved from their default creative tabs to the mod's custom creative tab.</p>
